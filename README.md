### *A dead simple personal ERC-20 token portfolio powered by the Unstoppable Domains Login.*

## Hackathon submission
This project was created as a submission for the [Integrating ‚ÄúLogin With Unstoppable‚Äù As A Dapp Login Option](https://gitcoin.co/issue/unstoppabledomains/gitcoin-bounties/1/100027208) bounty within Gitcoin's Grants Round 12 hackathon.

## Motivation for the project
It's a pain to manually create a watchlist of all your assets and many DeFi apps are very cumbersome and information overload. There's a need for an extremely lightweight and simple dApp that allows you to keep track of your current ERC-20 portfolio and its performance over various timeframes.

## Demo of the project
